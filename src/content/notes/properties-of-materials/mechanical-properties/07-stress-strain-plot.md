The below properties can be observed in a stress-strain plot.

- Elastic region
- Yield point
- Proof stress
- Plastic portion - steadily decreasing slope
- Ultimate tensile strength
- Localization of the deformation
- Young's modulus
- Upper and lower yield stresses
- Fractural strength

## Yield stress point

The point where plastic deformation starts in stress-strain diagram.

## Yield strength

Stress at yield stress point. Denoted by $\sigma_y$. Used when the strength of a
metal is cited for design purposes. $ $

True yield stress point is very difficult to find practically. Therefore
**strain offset method** is used to find an approximate yield strength.

### Strain offset method

A straight line is constructed parallel to the elastic portion of the
stress-strain curve at some specified strain offset. The stress corresponding to
the intersection of this line and the stress-strain curve is defined as the
yield strength $\sigma_y$. $ $

### 0.2% proof stress

Yield strength when $0.002$ is used in strain offset method. $ $

:::note[For steel]

Yield strength is taken as the average stress at the lower yield point. Strain
offset method is not required. Upper yield point occurs because of $\ce{C}$
atoms, and is specific to steel. $ $

## Observables

:::note

After yield point, gradient of the stress-strain curve decreases up to the
necking point. This is an indication that the material is becoming stronger and
harder.

### Ductility

Higher strain at fracture or failure strain.

Implies:

- Greatest percentage elongation

### Stiffness

Slope of the elastic region. Steeper line means more stiffness.

### Strengthness

- For ductile materials:
  [yield stress](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/stress-strain-plot/#yield-stress-point)
- For brittle materials: fracture stress

### Flexibility

Higher strain in elastic region.

### Toughness

Area under the curve, until the breaking point. Higher area means the higher
toughness.

## Tensile strength

After yielding, the stress necessary to continue plastic deformation increases
to a maximum, and then decreases.

### Ultimate tensile strength (UTS)

The maximum stress that can be sustained by a material in tension.

```math
\text{UTS} = \frac{\text{max load}}{\text{original cross-sectional area}}
```

Necking starts after UTS point.
