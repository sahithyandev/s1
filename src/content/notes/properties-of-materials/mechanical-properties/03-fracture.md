Separation of a solid into more than 1 parts under load or stress.

Based on the type of load:

- Tensile fracture
- Compressive fracture
- Shear fracture
- Fatigue fracture
- Creep fracture

Characterized into 2:

- Ductile fracture
- Brittle fracture

## Ductile fracture

Materials show significant amount of plastic deformation prior to fracture.
Fracture surface gives cup & cone appearance. Aka. cup-and-cone fracture.

Steps:

1. Specimen forms a neck
2. Cavities start to form within the neck
3. Cavities join with each other and form a crack
4. Crack propagates towards surface perpendicular to stress
5. Direction of crack changes to $45^\circ$

## Brittle fracture

Little or no plastic deformation prior to fracture. Fracture surface is smooth.

More dangerous than ductile fracture.

- No warning sign
- Crack propagates at very high speeds
- No need for extra stress during crack propagation
