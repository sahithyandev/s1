Electrical properties include the response of a material for an applied electric
field.

## Resistivity

Measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current.

### Resistance

$R=\rho\frac{l}{A}$

Not a property of a material.

### Temperature coefficient of resistivity

```math
\rho=\rho_0\Big[1 + \alpha(T-T_0)\Big]
```

Here:

- $\rho$ - resistivity at temperature $T$
- $\rho_0$ - resistivity at temperature $T_0$
- $\alpha$ - temperature coefficient of resistivity

## Conductivity

Reciprocal of the electrical resistivity.

$\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}$

Depends on:

- Number of available charge carriers
- Material's composition
- Material's structure
- Temperature
- Impurities

## Electron Mobility

When an electrical field is applied, the free electron in a solid can be
accelerated under force applied by electric field.

Force acting on a single electron is $â€“eE$. Here: $ $

- $e$ - charge of electron
- $E$ - electric field strength

In a solid, the electrons are scattered by obstacles such as atom
cores/imperfections etc. The electrons have a net drift at the direction
opposite to the electric field

## Drift Velocity

Average velocity attained by charge carriers accelerated in an electric field.

:::note

In a conductor, such as a wire, the charge carriers are typically electrons. Due
to thermal motion, electrons in a conductor have random velocities in all
different directions.

## Carrier Concentration

Number of charge carriers per unit volume. Usually denoted by $n$. $ $

## Current Density

Amount of electric current flowing through a unit area.

$J=nq\overline{\nu}=\sigma E$

Here:

- $n$ - carrier concentration
- $q$ - charge on a single charge carrier
- $\overline{\nu}$ - drift velocity
- $\sigma$ - conductivity
- $E$ - applied electric field

## Carrier Mobility

Denoted by $\mu$. $ $

```math
\mu=\frac{\overline{\nu}}{E}
\;\;
\text{and}
\;\;
\sigma=nq\mu
```
