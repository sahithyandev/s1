## Dielectric material

A material that is electrically insulating (non-metallic) and exhibits (or be
made to) an electric dipole structure. One of the common use cases of dielectric
materials is in capacitors.

## Electric Dipole Structure

A structure where the positive and negative charges are separated on atomic or
molecular level.

## Electric Polarization

In dielectric materials, the electric dipoles are aligned in one direction due
to the presence of the electric field. This alignment process is called
polarization.
