There won't be a crystal with 100% of perfect arrangement. Defects are
advantages in materials most of the time.

Types of defects:

- Point defects
- Line defects / Dislocations
- Planar defects
- Bulk defects - Related to volumetric defects. Common for any materials.
  Example: crack, holes.

:::note

Bulk defects are not covered in s1.

## Point defects

Related to a single atom.

- Vacancy - Missing parent atom
- Self-interstitial atom - A self atom entered into an interstitial site
- Interstitial impurity atom - A foreign atom entered into an interstitial site
- Substitutional impurity atom - A foreign atom replaced a parent atom or a
  vacancy

## Line defects

Related to a line of atoms. Three types:

- Edge dislocation - only covered in s1
- Screw dislocation
- Mixed dislocation (combination of above 2)

### Edge dislocation

Caused by removal of a half plane.

#### Half plane

Remaining part of a plane of atoms after a set of planes are gone missing.

#### Slip plane

Plane that is perpendicular to the half plane and on a boundary.

#### Dislocation line

Intersecting line of half plane and slip plane.

## Planar defects

Related to a plane of atoms.

### Solidification

The process of conversion liquid to solid. Occurs in 3 steps:

- Nucleation
- Growth of crystals
- Formation of grain structure

Tiny solid particles forms. Called as Nuclei (nothing related to atom's
nucleus). Each nucleus grows bigger and forms a crystal. And then forms grains.

### Grain

A group of atoms packed in a particular orientation that is different from that
of the neighbor ones.

Each grain is usually in micrometer in size. Grain structure can only be
observed through a microscope after careful preparation of samples
(microstructure).

### Grain boundaries

The boundary between 2 adjacent grains. These are the planar defects found in
crystalline materials.
