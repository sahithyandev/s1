## Corrosion

Deterioration of metals due to the reaction with the environment.

All corrosion reactions are electrochemical in nature.

:::note

If the water contained salt(s), metal chloride(s) will be formed. All metal
chlorides other than $\ce{NaCl, KCl}$ hydrolize in water, and produces acid.
Acids increase the rate of corrosion. $ $

## Electrochemical reactions

Pair of reactions in which electron transfer occurs from one reaction to
another.

### Oxidation

The reaction where an electron is released. Aka. anodic reaction.

### Reduction

The reaction where an electron is consumed. Aka. cathodic reaction.

## Electrodes

### Anode

The site at which oxidation takes place.

### Cathode

The site at which reduction takes place.

### Standard Electrode Potential

Measure of a metal's ability to work as a anode or cathode. Measured in
reference to hydrogen. Denoted by $E^\theta$. $ $

## Electrochemical series

A series of pure metals in the order of their standard electrode potential.
Alloys and other materials are not listed.

## Cell

When 2 electrodes are electrically connected. The metal with the least $E^0$
becomes the anode. $ $

### Cell potential

Absolute difference between the 2 electrode's standard electrode potentials.
Denoted by $\Delta E^0$. $ $

For a corrosion reaction to occur spontaneously, $\Delta E^0 \gt 0$. Cell
potential is an approximate indication of the rate of corrosion. $ $

## Common reactions

### Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)

```math
\ce{
2H^{+} + 2e^{-} -> H2
}
```

### Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)

```math
\ce{
O2 + H2O + 4e^{-} -> 4OH^{-}
}
```

## Examples

### Zn in acid

```math
\text{Anodic}:
\ce{
Zn -> Zn^{2+} + 2e
}
```

```math
\text{Cathodic}:
\ce{
2H^{+} + 2e -> H2
}
```

### Fe rusting in atmosphere

```math
\text{Anodic}:
\ce{
Fe -> Fe^{2+} + 2e
}
```

```math
\text{Cathodic}:
\ce{
1/2 O2 + H2O + 2e -> 2OH^{-}
}
```

:::note

$\ce{Al}$ doesn't corrode in atmosphere because $\ce{Al2O3}$ is stable and works
as a barrier between the metal and the atmosphere.

Steel corrodes but stainless steel doesn't. The reason is: stainless steel
contains $\ce{Cr}$ and $\ce{Cr2O3}$ is stable and it acts as a barrier.
