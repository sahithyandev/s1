Change in the chemical and/or physical structure of the polymer chain.

Degradation is undesirable during use but desirable after use (as in
biodegradation).

## Types of degradations

| Type of degradation    | Agent                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Thermal degradation    | Heat                         |
| Chemical degradation   | Chemical                     |
| Photo-degradation      | UV & other radiations        |
| Mechanical degradation | Stress                       |
| Biodegradation         | Bacteria and other organisms |

:::note

UV stablized - the polymer is protected from UV degradation.

## Susceptibility to degradation

Depends on its structure and the type of degradation.

- Chains containing aromatic functionality are suspectible to ultraviolet
  degradation
- Hydrocarbon-based polymers are susceptible to thermal degradation

## Bond rupture or scission

Breaking into smaller polymer chains. Molecular weight of the polymer decreases.

## Swelling & dissolution

Main form of degradation when a polymer is exposed to liquids.

### Swelling

The liquid or solute diffuses into the polymer. Polymer absorbs the liquid or
solute. Chain separation increases. Secondary inter-molecular bonding forces
decreases.

### Dissolution

Extreme state of swelling. Occurs when the polymer is completely soluable.
