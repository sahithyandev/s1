A material with

- any external dimension in the nanoscale (size range from approximately
  $1 â€“ 100\text{ nm}$).
- having internal structure or surface structure in the nanoscale.

At nanoscale, materials exhibit very unusual and very interesting properties.
For example, graphene has very high young's modulus and very high carrier
mobility.

## Nomenclature

### Nano-object

An object with any external dimension is in the nanoscale.

Examples:
[carbon nanotube](/properties-of-materials/nanotechnology/carbon-nanotubes),
[bucky ball](/properties-of-materials/basics/allotropy/#buckminsterfullerene).

### Nano-structured material

A material where its internal or surface structure is in the nanoscale.

Examples: $\ce{TiO2}$ nanotube films. $ $

### Nano in nature

- Lotus leaves being super-hydrophobic
- Gecko adhesive system

### Nano-science

Study of structures and materials on the nanoscale.

### Nanotechnology

Development of materials and devices by exploiting the characteristics of
particles on the nanoscale.

#### Applications

## Preparation of nanomaterials

### Top-down approach

Nanoscale dimensions are created using larger components, by externally
controlled devices.

Examples: Lithography, Etching techniques.

#### Photolithography

Can be used to create nanoscale patterns in thin films or bulk substrates.

The steps:

1. Coat $\ce{Si}$ wafer with a photosensitive material. A material which changes
   its properties when exposed to electromagnetic radiation
2. Add a mask and use an EM radiation.
3. Developer solution removes either reacted or unreacted material.
4. The silicon wafer is etched to transfer the pattern onto silicon wafer.
5. Photosensitive material is removed.

### Bottom-up approach

Molecular components arrange themselves into more complex nano
materials/objects.

Examples: Molecular self-assembly, Chemical vapour deposition
