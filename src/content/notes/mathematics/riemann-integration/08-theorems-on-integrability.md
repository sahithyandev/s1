## Theorem 1

Suppose $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is bounded, and integrable on $[c,b]$ for
all $c\in(a,b)$. Then $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$. Also valid for the other
end.

:::note[Proof Hint]

- Isolate a partition on the required end.
- Choose $x_1$ or $x_{n-1}$ such that $\Delta{x}<\frac{\epsilon}{4M}$ where $M$
  is an upper or lower bound.

## Theorem 2

Suppose $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is bounded, and continuous on $[c,b]$ for
all $c\in(a,b)$. Then $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$. Also valid for the other
end.
