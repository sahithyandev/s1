$n$-th roots of unity ($1$) are the complex numbers that satisfy the equation,
$z^n = 1$. There are $n$ distinct solutions.

```math
z = \exp\bigg({i\Big(\frac{2m\pi}{n}\Big)}\bigg)
\;\;
\text{where}
\;\;
m\in \mathbb{Z}\cup[0,n)
```

The solution can be written as $1, w, w^2, w^3, \dots, w^{n-1}$. $ $

$1$ is called the trivial solution. Other solutions are called as primitive
$n$-th roots.
