## Symmetric matrix

If $A=A^{T}$. Subset of square matrices. $ $

## Skew Symmetric matrix

If $A=-A^{T}$. Subset of square matrices. All elements in main diagonal are $0$.

:::note

Any square matrix can be expressed as a sum of a symmetric matrix and a
skew-symmetric matrix.

:::

## Complex conjucate of a matrix

Suppose $A=(\,a_{\text{ij}}\,)_{n\times n}$. Complex conjucate matrix of $A$ is:
$ $

```math
A^{\text{*}} = \overline{A^{T}} = (\,\overline{a_{\text{ji}}}\,)_{n\times n}
```

## Hermitian matrix

A square matrix $A$ is said to be a Hermitian matrix **iff**
$A=\overline{A^{T}}$.

## Skew Hermitian matrix

A square matrix $A$ is said to be a Hermitian matrix **iff**
$A=-\overline{A^{T}}$.

:::note

Any square matrix can be expressed as a sum of a hermitian matrix and a
skew-hermitian matrix.
