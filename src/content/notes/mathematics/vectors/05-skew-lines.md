Two non-parallel lines in 3D-space that do not intersect.

## Normal to 2 skew lines

Similar to
[Normal to 2 lines -- Straight Lines](/mathematics/vectors/straight-lines/#normal-to-2-lines).

## Distance between 2 skew lines

```math
\text{distance}=\lvert{\overrightarrow{AB}\cdot\underline{n}}\rvert
```

Here

- $\underline{n}$ is the unit normal to both $l_1,l_2$
- $A$ and $B$ are points lying on each line
