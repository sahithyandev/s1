A function $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ is a relation $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ which is
[everywhere defined](/mathematics/real-analysis/relations/#everywhere-defined)
and [not one-many](/mathematics/real-analysis/relations/#not-one-many).

- $dom(f)=A=preran(f)$

## Inverse

For a function $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ to have its inverse relation
$f^{-1}:\,B\rightarrow{A}$ be also a function:

- $f$ is [onto](/mathematics/real-analysis/relations/#onto)
- $f$ is [not many-one](/mathematics/real-analysis/relations/#not-many-one) (in
  other words, $f$ must be
  [one-one](/mathematics/real-analysis/relations/#one-one))

The above statement is true for all unrestricted function $f$ that has an
inverse $f^{-1}$:

$f(f^{-1}(x))=x=f^{-1}(f(x))=x$

## Real-valued functions

When both domain and codomains of a function are subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, the
function is said to be a real-valued function. $ $

## Odd and Even functions

### Odd function

A function $f$ that is $f(-x)=-f(x)\; \forall x \in \text{Dom}(f)$.

### Even function

A function $f$ that is $f(-x)=f(x)\; \forall x \in \text{Dom}(f)$.
