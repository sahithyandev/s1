## Kirchhoff Current Law

The algebraic sum of all the currents entering and leaving a node is zero. Based
on principle of conversation of charge.

```math
\sum_{\text{node}} I = 0 \implies \sum_{\text{in}} I = \sum_{\text{out}} I
```

## Kirchhoff Voltage Law

The algebraic sum of voltages around a loop is zero. Based on principle of
conversation of energy.

```math
\sum_{\text{node}} V = 0
```

## Voltage division

Series connection is used to divide voltage. Potentiometeres are commonly used
to create voltage divider circuits.

## Current division

Parallel connection is used to divide current.
