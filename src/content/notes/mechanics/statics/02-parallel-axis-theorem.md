```math
I_x = I_{x_1} + A\bar{y}^2
```

```math
I_y = I_{y_1} + A\bar{x}^2
```

```math
I_{xy} = I_{x_1 y_1} + A\bar{x}\bar{y}
```

Here

- On LHS, the moments of area are about some $ x $, $ y $ axes.
- On RHS, the moments of area are about centroidal axes $ x_1 $, $ y_1 $
  parallel to x, y.
- $ \bar{x} $ is the distance between $ x $ and $ x_2 $ axes.
- $ \bar{y} $ is the distance between $ y $ and $ y_1 $ axes.

:::note

$I_x$ is at a minimum when the axis is through the centroid. Same for $I_y$.
