## Definitions

### Algorithm

Finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a problem. Flowcharts
or pseudocode can be used ot explain it.

### Interpreter

A software that reads a source code file, goes through each line and runs the
code.

### Compiler

A software that reads a source code file, builds the software into a runnable
version.

## Python vs C

| Feature           | Python                                       | C                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Syntax            | High-level, easy to read and write           | Low-level, more complex and verbose      |
| Typing            | Dynamically typed                            | Statically typed                         |
| Memory Management | Automatic (Garbage Collection)               | Manual (malloc/free)                     |
| Performance       | Slower due to interpreted nature             | Faster due to compiled nature            |
| Use Cases         | Web development, data analysis, scripting    | System programming, embedded systems     |
| Standard Library  | Extensive                                    | Limited                                  |
| Compilation       | Interpreted                                  | Compiled                                 |
| Error Handling    | Exception handling                           | Error codes and manual checks            |
| Paradigms         | Multi-paradigm (procedural, OOP, functional) | Procedural                               |
| Portability       | Highly portable                              | Requires recompilation for each platform |
