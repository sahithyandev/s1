## Software

Refers to all the related things that are required to make a software system
work.

Includes:

- programs
- configuration files
- system and user documentation
- user support system
- bug fixes and updates

## Software engineering

An engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software
production. From the initial stage of writing the requirements to maintaining it
while being used.

## Software process

Set of activities that are associated with the development of a software
product.

Fundamental activities that are common to all types of software development
processes:

- Specification - defining the software to be produced and the runtime
  constraints
- Development - design and development of the software
- Validation - testing phase to check if the software meets the specifications
- Evolution - software is modified to adapt to new specifications

### Waterfall

All before-mentioned activities are done sequentially, as clear separate phases.
One phase is completed before the next phase is started.

### Iterative & incremental

System is developed in iteration. Smaller parts of the system is completed in
each iteration, that includes:

- Small amount of requirements specification
- Design and development for the specification
- Validation for the developed parts

### Component based

Existing components are combined to implement the system. Main concentration is
on the integration of the components.

## Quality of software

Can be measured using these aspects:

- Maintainability - how easy it is to making changes
- Dependability - how secure, reliable it is to failures or other unusual
  activities
- Efficiency - how efficiently hardware resources (such as memory, processor
  time, disk space) are used
- Usability - how easy it is to use the software from user's perspective
- Robustness - how resilient it is to invalid inputs

## Challenges in software engineering

- Complexity
  - Essential - inherent, difficult to overcome
  - Accidental - not inherent, can be overcome
- Conformity
- Changeability - expected to be changeable to greater extent
- Invisibility - not visualizable
- Can't guarantee defect free software - no amount of testing can prove absence
  of defects
