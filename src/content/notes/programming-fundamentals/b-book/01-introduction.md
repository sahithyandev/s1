Computers are used to process data and produce useful information.

## Terminology

### Bit

A binary digit. Either a $0$ or a $1$.

### Byte

A collection of 8 bytes. Aka. octet.

#### Octet vs Byte

In the early days of computing, a byte wasn't always 8 bits - different
computers used different byte lengths ranging from 1 to 48 bits. An octet
specifically refers to 8 bits and was used to avoid ambiguity, especially in
networking protocols. Over time, the 8-bit byte became standard and now byte and
octet mean the exact same thing, though octet remains common in networking
contexts.

### Information

Computers can process various types of data. When a communication link (such as
Internet) is provided, the data can be transferred to other users despite of
distance. The computer and communication technologies that made this possible
are together referred to as information technology or IT (or, sometimes as
information and communication technology or ICT). Computers are therefore at the
heart of IT.

An information system is a system with well-defined procedures and techniques to
collect, store, process, and disseminate information.
