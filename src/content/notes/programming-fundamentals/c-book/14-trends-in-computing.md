## Current Trends

### Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a subscription-based service which provides a pool of
configurable computer resources: storage, networks, servers, applications, and
services, over the internet.

Advantages:

- On-demand
- Cost effective for users

Disadvantages:

- Possible downtime
- Security & Privacy concerns

### Augmented Reality

Augments / supplements userâ€™s physical, real-world environment with computer
generated sensory inputs such as video, sound, graphics, or location (E.g.: GPS)
data. Users can visualize information about the environment and its objects
which are laid on top the real world.

Applicable for many fields including architecture, art, commerce, education,
gaming, medical, etc.

### Ubiquitous Computing

The concept of enabling computing everywhere at any time. Aka. pervasive
computing.

Examples: smart phones, PDA (Personal Digital Assist), smart glasses, digital
watches, and interactive white boards.

#### Characteristics

- Very tiny in physical size
- Being integrated into any shape of device and displacing services of desktop
  systems
- Augment the original use-value of devices they are embedded
- Communicating through increasing interconnected networks

## Future Trends

### GPU-Accelerated Computing

GPU-accelerated computing is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU)
together with a CPU to accelerate scientific, engineering, and enterprise
applications. Compute-intensive work is offloaded to a GPU while the remaining
work is carried out by CPU. Enables applications to run significantly faster.

### Reconfigurable Computing

Reconfigurable computing is a computer architecture combining some of the
flexibility of software with the high performance of hardware by processing with
very flexible, high speed, computing fabrics like field- programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs).

The principal difference when compared to using ordinary microprocessors is the
ability to make substantial changes to the data path and to the control flow. On
the other hand, the main difference with custom hardware, i.e.,
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is the possibility to adapt the
hardware during runtime by "loading" a new circuit on the reconfigurable fabric.

### Quantum Computing

A quantum computer makes direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as
superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum
computation uses qubits (quantum bits), which can be in a superposition of
states. A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine, also known as the
universal quantum computer.
