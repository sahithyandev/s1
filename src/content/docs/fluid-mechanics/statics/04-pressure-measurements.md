## Barometer

## Piezometer

Open-ended tube connected to a vessel / pipe containing a liquid.

Measures the pressure head of a liquid.

### Advantages

- Simple
- Small pressure differences can be measured

### Disadvantages

- Only for liquids
- Long tube required to measure even moderate pressures

## Manometer

![Manometer](/fluids/manometer.jpg)

Hydrostatic principle is used here. Measures absolute pressure. Manometer liquid
should not mix with the liquid in which the pressure is to be measured.

```math
P_x = P_y
```

```math
P_{A} + a\rho g = P_{\text{atm}} + h \rho_{m} g
```

```math
P_{A} = P_{\text{atm}} + h \rho_{m}g - a\rho g
```

### Differential Manometer

![Differential Manometer](/fluids/differential-manometer.jpg)

Used to measure pressure difference between two points. Can be used for both
liquids and gases. Difficult to measure small pressure differences (because
small displacement of manometer liquid).

## Pressure Gauges

### Bourdon Pressure Gauge

#### Advantages

- Easy to use
- Wide range of pressures can be measured

#### Disadvantages

- Not very accurate
- Needs to be calibrated regularly
