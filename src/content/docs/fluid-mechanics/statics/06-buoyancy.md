Thrust exerted on a submerged object in a liquid. Direction is vertically
upwards. Line of action passes through center of buoyancy.

```math
u=\text{weight of displaced fluid}=v\rho{g}
```

Here:

- $u$ - the upthrust
- $v$ - the submerged volume
- $\rho$ - density of the fluid

## Center of buoyancy

Center of gravity of the displaced fluid volume. **NOT** the center of gravity
of the submerged object.

## Proof

Forces exerted on the submerged object is equivalent to forces exerted on the
displaced volume before it was displaced.

Consider the equilibrium of displaced volume before it was displaced:

```math
\text{Weight}=W=\text{Resultant force exerted by surrounding liquid}=F
```

$F$ must be equal to $W$, opposite to $W$ and acts through $G$ of the considered
volume of fluid.
