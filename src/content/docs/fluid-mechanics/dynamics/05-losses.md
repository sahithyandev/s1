Energy loss in fluid motion is directly proportional to $v^2$ where $v$ is the
velocity.

## Types

### Local loss

Occurs when there is a sudden change in flow.

```math
K_L
\frac{v^2}{2g}
```

Here:

- $K_L$ - local loss coefficient
- $v$ - velocity
- $g$ - gravitational acceleration

### Friction loss

Occurs because of

- viscosity
- friction between fluid and pipe wall

When the fluid is under turbulent flow:

```math
\lambda
\frac{L}{D}
\frac{v^2}{2g}
```

Here:

- $\lambda$ - friction factor
- $L$ - length of the pipe
- $D$ - diameter of the pipe
- $v$ - velocity
- $g$ - gravitational acceleration
