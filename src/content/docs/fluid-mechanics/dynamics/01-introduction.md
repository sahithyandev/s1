### Flow

Motion with relative movement between fluid particles where continuous
deformation happens.

## Flow patterns

### Streamline

A line tangential to the flow velocity.

### Streamtube

A passage enclosed by a collection of streamlines.

### Pathline

Path traced by an individual fluid particle.

### Streakline

Suppose a dye is injected into a fluid flow. Streakline indicates the positions
of all particles passed through the point of injection.

:::note

In steady flow: streamline, pathline and streakline all coincide.
