## Density

### Incompressible

Density doesn't vary significantly.

Examples:

- Pipe and channel flows of liquids
- Gas flows in pipes

```math
\frac{|\Delta{\rho}|}{\rho} \ll 1
```

### Compressible

Density varies significantly.

Examples:

- Pressure surges in pipes

## Viscosity

### Non-viscous

Fluid doesn't show any resistance to the flow.

### Viscous

Fluid shows any resistance to the flow.

- **Newtonian**: $\mu\text{ is constant}$  
  Examples: Water
- **Non-newtonian**: $\mu\text{ is not constant}$  
  Examples: Paints, Clay, Plastics

## Variation of parameters

The parameters:

- Velocity $V$
- Pressure $P$
- Flow rate $Q$

### Temporal Variation

The variation of the parameters with time.

#### Steady

Parameters don't change with time at a point. $V=f(x,y,z)$. $ $

#### Unsteady

Parameters changes with time at a point.

### Spatial Variation

The variation of the parameters with coordinates.

#### Uniform

Parameters don't change with the location of the point. $V=f(t)$. $ $

#### Non-uniform

Parameters change with the location of the point.

## Dimensional

If a variation of flow parameter in a certain direction can be neglected, that
can reduce the calculations.

## Nature of movement

### Laminar

Fluid particles move in a orderly fashion.

### Turbulent

Fluid particles move disorderly.

## Rotation of particles

### Rotational

Fluid particles rotate while moving. Usually due to shear forces. Flow of real
fluids.

### Non-rotational

Fluid particles don't rotate while moving. Only when there are no shear forces.
Flow of frictionless forces.
