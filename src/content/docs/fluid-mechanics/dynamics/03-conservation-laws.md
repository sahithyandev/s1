In fluid dynamics, 4 laws are used to analyse the fluid flow.

- Laws of mechanics
- Conservation of mass
- Conservation of energy
- Conservation of momentum

These laws are applied to a specific volume of the fluid in motion, and it's
called as control volume.

### Control volume

A fixed volume, through which a fluid flows. Can either be real or imaginary.

## Conservation of mass

Mass cannot be created nor destroyed.

## Conservation of energy

Energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Can only be converted from one form to
another.

## Conservation of momentum

A mass cannot gain or lose momentum unless a resultant force is exerted on it.

### Momentum

```math
M = \text{mass}\times\text{velocity}= mv
```
