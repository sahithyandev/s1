Resistance, in terms of physical dimensions:

```math
R = \frac{\rho l}{A}
```

Here:

- $ l $: length
- $ A $: cross-sectional area
- $ \rho $:
  [resistivity](/properties-of-materials/electrical-properties/introduction/#resistivity)

If a voltage $ V $ is applied across a conductor, then a given current $ I $
will flow through the conductor $ V \propto I $. The proportionality constant is
called resistance $ R $.

```math
R = \frac{V}{I}
```
