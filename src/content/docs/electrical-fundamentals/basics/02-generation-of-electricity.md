Many forms of energy can be converted to electricity.

## Sources of energy

- Pressure head of water
- Chemical energy of fuels
- Nuclear energy of radioactive substances
- Wind energy
- Solar energy

## Hydro power

Potential energy of water is converted to mechanical energy using water
turbines. The water turbines are connected to alternators which generate the
alternating electricity.

### Penstock

Large pipes laid on a slope. Carries water from a reservoir to a turbine. Used
to increase the velocity of the water.

### Surge tank

Aka. surge chamber. A cylindrical tank. Connected with penstock. Placed near the
powerhouse. Used to control the pressure of water in penstock.

### Main Inlet Valve (MIV)

A valve installed in between the penstock and the
[turbine](/fluid-mechanics/machinery/turbines). Used to stop water in the middle
for maintanence purposes.

## Fuel energy

Examples for fuels:

- Coal (solid)
- Oil, Diesel (liquid)
- Natural gas (gas)

Heat energy of fuels is converted to mechanical energy (using steam turbines or
internal combustion engines). Alternators are driven by the mechanical energy.

## Nuclear energy

Heat produced during nuclear fission is used to drive the prime mover. Steam
turbines are used here.

## Wine energy

Wind turbines are the prime movers.
