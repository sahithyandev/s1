A device for making and breaking a circuit. Operated by hand or automatically.
Can be used to isolate part of a circuits. More accurate protection compared to
semi-enclosed or fully-enclosed fuse.

Things to consider when choosing a circuit breaker:

- the normal current it will have to carry
- the amount of current it will have to interrupt

## Protection

### Earth leakage current

Can be used to detect electrical faults to earth in electrical. There are 2
types of circuit breakers to detect electrical faults to earth.

- Voltage operated protection -

- Current operated protection -
  [Residual Current Circuit Breaker](/electrical-fundamentals/electrical-installation/rccb)
  or
  [Residual Current Device](/electrical-fundamentals/electrical-installation/rcd)

The earth leakage protection device is called as trip switch.
