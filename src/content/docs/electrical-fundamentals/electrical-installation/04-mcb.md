Short for miniature circuit breaker. Not main circuit breaker. Each sub circuit
in the consumer unit starts with a MCB. Protects against overcurrent.

### Advantages

Advantages of a MCB over fuses:

- **Non-destructive**
- **Fast**
  - Shorter tripping times under moderate overcurrents
  - Immediate indication of faulty current
- **Manual operation**: can be used as a circuit control switch
- **Easy to use**
  - No stock of fuses required
  - Reclosing can be effected at once after the fault has been cleared
- **More accurate**

MCBs are more expensive than fuses.

### Ratings

- Rated current
- Rated voltage (single phase and 3-phase)

## Mechanism

![MCB](/electrical/mcb.jpg)

Has 4 functional components:

- A thermal overload trip (bi-metal)  
  For small overloads and time-graded operation
- An electromagnetic short-circuit trip  
  For high fault currents and near-instantaneous operation
- A switching mechanism with contacts
- Arc exhausting system

### Function of the thermal device

![Thermal device of MCB](/electrical/function-of-mcb-thermal.jpg)

Consists of a bi-metal strip. When overheated from overload current, the
bi-metal strip is deflected. The deflection depends on the heat which depends
on:

- Intensity of current flow
- Duration

### Function of the EM device

![EM device of MCB](/electrical/function-of-mcb-em.jpg)

Consists of a solenoid coil. Load current is set to flow through the coil.

In this coil, there is a fixed iron-core with a movable armature. When the
current exceeds the rated value, the coil exerts sufficient electromagnetic
force to attract the armature against the force of the spring. A switch
mechanism is activated by the lever, to open the contacts.
