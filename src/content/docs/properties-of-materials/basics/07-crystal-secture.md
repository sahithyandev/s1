Materials are categorized into 2, based on the arrangement of atoms or
molecules.

- Crystalline
- Amorphous

## Crystalline

Atoms or molecules are arranged in a ordered structure. Long-order is present.
Situated in a repeating array over large atomic distances (long-range order).

Examples:

- Metals
- Ceramics

Atomic arrangement is usually described by
**[space lattice](/properties-of-materials/basics/space-lattice)**.

## Amorphous (or Non Crystalline)

Atoms or molecules are randomly arranged. Long-range order is absent.

Example:

- Glass
- Polymers are semi-crystalline
