An infinite set of equally-spaced **points** in a space.

Set of lines are used to connect these points to provide a useful guide to the
eye. They are not part of the lattice.

## Unit Cell

Smallest repeating parallelepiped inside the lattice. By stacking in all
directions, the lattice can be formed.

### Density

```math
\rho=
\frac{\text{Mass/unit cell}}{\text{Volume/unit cell}} =
\frac{M n}{v L}
```

Here:

- $M$ - molar mass
- $n$ - atoms per unit cell
- $v$ - volume of the unit cell
- $L$ - avagadro's number

:::note

The total number of atoms stays the same when one structure transitions into
another.

## Crystalline systems

- All crystalline materials fall within one of the 7 possible shapes and 4
  variants.

#### The shapes

Don't have to memorize.

- Cubic
- Hexagonal
- Tetragonal
- Rhombohedral (Trigonal)
- Orthorrhombic
- Monoclinic
- Triclinic

#### The variants

- Simple: atoms at the corners only.
- Base-centered: atoms at the corners and center of 2 opposing sides only.
- Body-centered: atoms at the corners and center only.
- Face-centered: atoms at the corners and center of all faces only.

Bravais showed that only **14** of 28 (7 shapes x 4 variants) are possible in
real life.

Only 4 of them are studied in s1.

- Simple cubic (**sc**)
- Body-centered cubic (**bcc**)
- Face-centered cubic (**fcc**)
- Hexagonal close packed or Close packed hexagonal (**hcp/cph**)

## Coordination number

Coordination number of a lattice system is the number of particles that each
particle contacts.

## Atomic Packing Factor (APF)

```math
\text{APF} = \frac{\text{True volume}}{\text{Bulk volume}} =
\frac{\text{Volume of atoms/unit cell}}{\text{Volume/unit cell}}
```

Geometrically maximum APF in real life (assuming spherical and identical atoms)
is 74%. If a structure has 74% APF, the structure is called a **close-packed
structure**. The APF can be increased to a maximum of 79% by adding impurities.

## Interstitial sites (aka holes, voids)

Empty space that exists between the packing of atoms in a crystal structure.

## Octahedral interstices

Locations of void spaces available in an FCC. Located at the center of each edge
and body-center of the unit cell.
