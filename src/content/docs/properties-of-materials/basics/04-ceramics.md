Inter-molecular bonds: covalent and/or ionic.

## Properties

- Non metallic
- Inorganic
- Produced by shaping and firing
- High melting temperatures (some can survive upto $8000Â°\;\text{C}$)
- Low density
- High strength, stiffness, hardness
- Corrosion-resistant
- Generally good insulators (electrical and thermal)
- Brittle as glass. Behaves glass-like mostly.

:::note[Glass]

**Not** an element of ceramics. Hugely differs in structure. Can be used to
store liquids. Soluable in $\ce{HF}$. $ $

:::

Some ceramic materials are:

- magnetic
- [piezoelectric](/properties-of-materials/electrical-properties/piezoelectricity/)
- superconductors (only few, and only at very low temperatures)

### Refractory ceramics

Ceramics that can withstand high temperatures. Can provide thermal insulation.

## Types

2 types:

- Traditional - clay-based items like pottery, porcelain, and tiles
- Advanced - like silicon carbide, boron nitride, zirconia

## Examples

- Alumina
- Sand
- Tiles
- Cement
- Concrete
