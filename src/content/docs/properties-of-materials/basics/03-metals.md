Generally isotropic, and crystalline. Can be made amorphous by melting and then
suddenly cooling a sample. Metals can be categorized into 2 types.

### Pure Metals

Inter-molecular bonds: Metallic bonds. Commonly not used in the pure form.

Pure metals might be:

- not strong enough
- too weak to
  [corrosion](/properties-of-materials/degradation/forms-of-corrosion/)

### Alloys

Which contain more than one metallic element.

Examples:

- Steel $[\ce{Fe}+\ce{C}]$
- Cast Iron $[\ce{Fe}+\ce{C}]$
- Brass $[\ce{Cu}+\ce{Zn}]$
- Bronze $[\ce{Cu}+\ce{Sn}]$
- Gold jewelry $[\ce{Au}+\ce{Cu}]$
- Duralumin $[\ce{Al}+\ce{Cu}]$ - used for aircraft body
- Stainless steel $[\ce{Fe}+\ce{C}+\ce{Cr}+\ce{Ni}]$,
- Cast iron $[\ce{Fe}+\ce{C}]$

Alloys have a parent metal (mostly used metal, percentage-wise) and one or more
alloying elements (all elements other than parent metal).

:::note

Steel has maximum of $2\%\; \ce{C}$ and it's
[ductile](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/ductility) (won't break
easily). Cast Iron has $2\%-4\% \ce{C}$ and it's
[brittle](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/ductility#brittle)
(will break easily).

:::

#### Super Alloys

Alloys containing too many alloying elements (maybe even 20).

## Properties

- $\ce{Fe}, \ce{Co}, \ce{Ni}$, and their alloys are magnetic
- Good electrical conductivity
- Good thermal conductivity
- High strength
- High stiffness (= high
  [young's modulus](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/elasticity/#youngs-modulus))
- Good ductility
