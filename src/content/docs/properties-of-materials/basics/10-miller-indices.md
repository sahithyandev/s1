![Miller Indices in Simple Cubic](/props/miller-indices.jpg)

Any vertex can be chosen as the origin.

## Notation

- Minus noted with a bar
- Addition and subtraction is carried out like vectors
- $ (1,1,0) $ - Atom/Vertex
- $ [110] $ - Direction, **no commas**
- $\text{<}110\text{>}$ - Family of directions
- $ (100) $ - Plane, **no commas**
- $\set{100}$ - Family of planes
- Always will be whole numbers. Fractions must be multiplied by LCM.

## Direction

Equivalent directions are grouped into a **family**.

### Direction families

#### <100>

- No of planes: $6$
- $[100],[010],[001],[\bar{1}00],[0\bar{1}0],[00\bar{1}]$

#### <110>

- No of planes: $12$
- $[011],[01\bar{1}],[0\bar{1}1],[0\bar{1}\bar{1}],[101],[10\bar{1}],[\bar{1}01],[\bar{1}0\bar{1}],[110],[1\bar{1}0],[\bar{1}10],[\bar{1}\bar{1}0]$

#### <111>

- No of planes: $8$
- $[111],[11\bar{1}],[1\bar{1}1],[\bar{1}11],[\bar{1}\bar{1}1],[\bar{1}1\bar{1}],[1\bar{1}\bar{1}],[\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}]$

The above are the common directions. There are other directions as well.

### Show the direction

To show the direction $ [132] $, for example: $ $

Take the point $ (1,3,2) $. Divide by the highest number ($3$, in this case) to
bring the point inside the unit cell. The resulting point will be
$(\frac{1}{3},1,\frac{2}{3})$. The direction is given by vector from $(0,0,0)$
to the resulting point.

### Close packed direction

All neighbour atoms in a direction touch each other. For example: $(110)$ of
fcc. $ $

## Plane

### Steps

- If sitting on any axes, move the origin.
- Find the intercepts. $\infty$ if parallel.
- Find the reciprocals.

### Plane families

#### 100

- Denotes as $\set{100}$
- No of planes: $6$
- $(100),(010),(001),(\bar{1}00),(0\bar{1}0),(00\bar{1})$

#### 110

- Denotes as $\set{110}$
- No of planes: $12$
- $(011),(01\bar{1}),(0\bar{1}1),(0\bar{1}\bar{1}),(101),(10\bar{1}),(\bar{1}01),(\bar{1}0\bar{1}),(110),(1\bar{1}0),(\bar{1}10),(\bar{1}\bar{1}0)$

#### 111

- Denotes as $\set{111}$
- No of planes: $8$
- $(111),(11\bar{1}),(1\bar{1}1),(\bar{1}11),(\bar{1}\bar{1}1),(\bar{1}1\bar{1}),(1\bar{1}\bar{1}),(\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1})$

The above are the common planes. There are other planes as well.

### Show the plane

- Divide by the smallest non-zero number.
- Find the reciprocals. $\infty$ means parallel to the axis.

### Close packed plane

All neighbour atoms in a crystal plane touch each other. For example: $(111)$ of
fcc. $ $

### Planar Density / Aerial Density

Number of atoms in a unit area in a specific plane. Differs between different
planes in a single crystal structure.
