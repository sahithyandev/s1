Ability of a single substance to exist in more than one physical form.

## Examples

### Iron

- $\alpha-\ce{Fe}$ (Ferrite) - Below $912\degree \text{C}$
- $\gamma-\ce{Fe}$ (Austenite) - Between $912\degree \text{C}$ and
  $1394\degree \text{C}$
- $\delta-\ce{Fe}$ - Above $1394\degree \text{C}$
- $\epsilon-\ce{Fe}$ (Hexaferrum)

First 3 exist in atmospheric pressure. Forth one exists in very high pressure.

:::note

$\beta-\ce{Fe}$ is the paramagnetic form of $\alpha-\ce{Fe}$.

### Carbon

- Graphite
- Diamond
- [Carbon nanotubes](/properties-of-materials/nanotechnology/carbon-nanotubes)

#### Buckminsterfullerene

Aka. bucky ball. Has $60\;\ce{C}$ atoms inside a molecule. A molecule is
truncated icosahedron shaped. Diameter of the molecule is approx.
$1\,\text{nm}$. Each carbon atom is bonded to another 3. Not chemically inert.
