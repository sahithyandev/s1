This is a separate unit itself and taught as the last thing in the module.

Materials are categorized into a tree.

![Classification of Materials](/props/materials-classification.jpg)

In computerized selection software, materials are stored in the above structure.

## Selection process

Seeking the best match between design requirements and property profiles of
materials. Has 4 main steps.

### Translation

Identification of requirements. The requirements include:

- Function - what does it have to do?
- Constraints - what non-negotiable conditions must be bet?
- Objective - what is to be maximized or minimized?
- Free variables - what parameters of the problem are free to be changed?

### Screening

Eliminating materials that do not meet the constraints.

### Ranking

Materials are ranked according to certain criteria involving multiple
dimensions. Done based on objectives.

#### Material index

Property of property group that maximizes performance for a given design.

### Supporting information

A few materials are filtered through the above steps. After this, additional
information (such as listed below) are considered to choose one.

- Price
- Availability

:::note

Nowadays software is used to select materials. World-wide accepted software is
Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES). Expensive and powerful.
