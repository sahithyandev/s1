[Stress-strain plot](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/stress-strain-plot/)
will be produced in the test.

## Testing setup

Follows ASTM Standards E 8 and E 8M. (American Society for Testing and
Materials).

The specimen: ![Tensile Test Specimen](/props/tensile-test-specimen.jpg)

Here

- Gauge length $l_0$
- Initial diameter $d_0$
- Initial area $A_0=\frac{\pi{d_0}^2}{4}$

The setup: ![Tensile Test Setup](/props/tensile-test-setup.jpg)

Test will be done until the specimen fractures. Results are converted to
engineering stress and strain, and plotted.

### Load cell

Measures the force applied to the specimen.

### Extensometer

Used to measures the elongation (increase in length) in the specimen.

## Necking

All deformation up to the maximum point is uniform throughout the specimen.

At this maximum stress, a neck begins to form – known as necking. All subsequent
deformation is confined to this neck.

## For brittle material

The σ-ε behavior of brittle materials cannot be assessed by a tensile test
because:

- Difficult to prepare test specimens
- Difficult to grip brittle materials without fracturing them

Hence, fracture strength is specified for engineering design purposes. Tensile
strength is calculated from its **modulus of rupture (MOR)** or **flexural
strength** value.

```math
\text{Tensile strength} \times 1.3 = \text{MOR}
```
