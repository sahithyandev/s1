A measure of the degree of plastic deformation at fracture.

Most metals are ductile. Ductile materials have high tensile strength.

### Percentage elongation

```math
\frac{l_f - l_0}{l_0} \times 100%
```

### Percentage reduction in area

```math
\frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0} \times 100%
```

## Brittle

A material that experiences very little or no plastic deformation.

Brittleness order: Ionic bonds > Covalent bonds > Metallic bonds

## Malleability

Ability of a material to undergo plastic deformation under compression.

:::note

All ductile materials are malleable. Converse is **not** true.

## Ductility & Brittleness

Depends on:

- Composition of the material
- Temperature
