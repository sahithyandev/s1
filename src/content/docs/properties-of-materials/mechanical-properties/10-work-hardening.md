Strength and hardness of a metal increases as a result of plastic deformation.
This process is called work hardening.

Increases:

- strength
- hardness

Decreases:

- ductility
- toughness

## Steps

- Specimen is loaded onto a
  [tensile test](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/tensile-test)
  apparatus
- Test is stopped after the specimen has plastically deformed and haven't
  reached UTS
- Specimen is unloaded and reloaded
- New $\sigma-\epsilon$ diagram will have an increased yield strength
