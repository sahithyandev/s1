Hardness of metals is defined as resistance to indentation. Can be measured by
[indentation test](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/indentation-test).

When 2 surfaces are rubbing against each other, hardness is important. Materials
with less hardness will be worn off quickly. Only materials with high hardness,
can cut through materials with light hardness. Diamond is the hardest material.
