Maximum strain energy, a material can absorb upto fracture. Area under the
$\sigma-\epsilon$ graph is a measure of toughness. Can be measured by
[impact test](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/impact-test). $ $

Generally ductile materials have a high toughness compared to brittle materials.
