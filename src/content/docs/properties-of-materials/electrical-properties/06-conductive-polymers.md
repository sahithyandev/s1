A class of polymers that conduct electricity. aka. intrinsically conducting
polymers.

Unlike traditional polymers, conductive polymers have a conjugated system of
double bonds which allows them to conduct electrical charge.

## Conjugated polymers

Organic macromolecules that are characterized by a backbone chain of alternating
double- and single-bonds.

Their overlapping p-orbitals create a system of delocalized $\pi$-electrons,
which can result in interesting and useful optical and electronic properties. $
$

Doping can be used to further enhance electrical conductivity of these polymers.

## Uses

- Organic solar cells
- Microwave-absorbent coatings
- Electroluminescence

## Examples

- Polyaniline (PANI)
- Polypyrrole (PPy)
- Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)
- Polythiophene (PT)
