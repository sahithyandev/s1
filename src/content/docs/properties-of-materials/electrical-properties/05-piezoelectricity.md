## Piezoelectric Materials

When a piece of piezoelectric material is mechanically deformed, a current will
flow and charge its faces. and vice versa, it will be deformed when exerted to
an electrical field.

```math
Q=d\times F
```

Here:

- $Q$ - charge stored
- $d$ - charge sensitivity (a material property)
- $F$ - applied force

```math
C=\epsilon\frac{A}{t} \implies V=\frac{d}{\epsilon}\sigma t
```

Here:

- $V$ - applied voltage
- $d$ - charge sensitivity
- $\epsilon$ - permittivity
- $\sigma$ - applied stress
- $t$ - thickness

## Uses

- Converting mechanical stresses into electrical signals
- Producing ultrasonic sounds
- Producing X-rays
- Converting sounds to electrical signals
- In nano-precision actuators

### Piezoelectric Transducer

Can be used to measure changes in pressure, force, acceleration, strain by
converting them into an electrical signal. The applied force (or pressure) to
piezoelectric crystal would generate a voltage.
