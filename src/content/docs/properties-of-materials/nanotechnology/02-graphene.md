$\ce{C}$ atoms arranged to a hexagonal network. 2D crystal based. Has $3$ fold
symmetry. Single sheet of graphite.

## Unit Cell

- A rhombus with $120°$
- Lattice parameter (side length of a unit cell) $a=2d\cos{30}°=\sqrt3 d$ where
  $d$ is the $\text{C}-\text{C}$ bond length
- 2 atoms per unit cell

:::note

Single layer of graphene was discovered using scotch tape method and the
discovery won a Nobel prize in 2010.
