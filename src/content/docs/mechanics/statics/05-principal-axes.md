An axis through which the product of moment of area is $0$. $ $

```math
I_{xy} = 0
```

There will be 2 principal axes which are perpendicular to each other.

If a plane area has more than 2 axes of symmetries, all centroidal axes will be
principal centroidal axes. In such case, second moment of area with respect to
any centroidal axis will be a constant.

## Principal second moments of area

Second moments about the principal axes.

About principal axes second moments of area will be at minimum and maximum.

## Centroidal principal axes

Principal axes through the centroid. An axis of symmetry is a centroidal
principal axis.
