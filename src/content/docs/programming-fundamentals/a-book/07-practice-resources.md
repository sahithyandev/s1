## Programs

The programs are listed in no specific order.

1. **is prime number**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and outputs whether
   its a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) or not.
2. **factors**: Take in a number from user. Output all of its factors.
3. **n-th factorial**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and outputs n-th
   [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).
4. **is perfect number**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and outputs
   whether its a [perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number).
5. **fibonacci numbers**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and prints all
   [fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) less
   than or equal to $n$.
6. **determinant of matrix**: Take in a matrix from user. Output the determinant
   of the matrix. First try for $2\times 2$. Then go higher-ordered matrices.
7. **pascal's triangle**: Take $n$ from user input. Print
   [pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) to $n$
   rows.
8. **is valid palindrome**: Take a string input from user. Output if the input
   is palindrome or not. A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all
   uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric
   characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters
   include letters and numbers. Try not to use `[::-1]`.
9. **armstrong numbers**: Take $n$ from user input. Print all
   [armstrong numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) (in
   base 10, of course) between 0 and $n$ (inclusive).
10. **letter analysis**: Take a text input from user. Find how many times each
    letter is being used in that string. Use a `dictionary` to store the data.
    Output the final results. Try to read the text from a `.txt` file as well.
11. **word length analysis**: Take a string input from user. Print length of
    each word separated by a space. Try to include the summary using a
    `dictionary`.
12. **letter expanding**: A program that converts _b3j8k2_ to _bbbjjjjjjjjkk_.
    The number can be 1 to 99.
13. **binary addition**: Take in 2 numbers in binary (as strings) and output the
    sum of both numbers. Try not to use `bin` function.
14. **big integer addition**: Given _a very large integer_ represented as a
    list, where each `digits[i]` is the $i^{\text{th}}$ digit of the integer.
    The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in
    left-to-right order. Increment the large integer by one and return the
    resulting array of digits. Don't construct a `int` object.
15. **stack implementation**
16. **queue implementation**

## Platforms

- Codewars - https://codewars.com (my most preferred one)
- HackerRank - https://hackerrank.com
- Leetcode - https://leetcode.com (my least preferred one)

When a coding problem feels too hard, just skip and try another problem.
