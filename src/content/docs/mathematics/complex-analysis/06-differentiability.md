A complex function $f$ is differentiable at $z_0$ **iff**:

```math
\lim_\limits{z\to z_0}{\frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}} = L = f'(z_0)
```

$f'(z_0)$ is called the derivative of $f$ at $z_0$. Properties of
[Differentiability | Real Analysis](/mathematics/real-analysis/differentiability/)
can be applied to complex functions.

## Singular point

A point $z_0$ where $f(z)$ is not differentiable.

## Neighbourhood

Suppose $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$. A neighborhood of $z_0$ is the region contained in
the circle $|z âˆ’ z_0| = r \gt 0$.
