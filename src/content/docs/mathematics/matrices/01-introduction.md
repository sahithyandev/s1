Revise Matrices unit from G.C.E. (A/L) Combined Mathematics and G.C.E. (O/L)
Mathematics.

## Types of matrices

### Zero matrix / Null matrix

All elements are $0$. $ $

### Column matrix (column vector)

Only $1$ column. $ $

### Row matrix (row vector)

Only $1$ row. $ $

### Square matrix

Number of columns equal to number of rows.

:::note[Main diagonals of a square matrix]

Formed by elements having equal subscripts.

:::

### Triangular matrix

#### Upper triangular matrix

All elements below the main diagonal are $0$. Subset of square matrices. $ $

#### Lower triangular matrix

All elements above the main diagonal are $0$. Subset of square matrices. $ $

### Diagonal matrix

A square matrix whose with non-zero elements only on the main diagonal. Denoted
by $D$. Subset of upper and lower triangular matrices. $ $

### Identity matrix

Aka. unit matrix. A diagonal matrix and all diagonal elements are $1$. Denoted
by $I$. Subset of diagonal matrices.

## Matrix operations

### Addition and subtraction

Order of the 2 matrices must be same. Matrix obtained by adding or subtracting
corresponding elements.

### Scalar multiplication

Matrix obtained by multiplying all elements by the scalar.
